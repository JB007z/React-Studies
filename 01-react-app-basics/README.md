# React basics tutorial
This is not a project it's just a simple React page to learn about the basics and also I am trying to experiment using Bootstrap more

## ðŸ§ª What I've Learned

- **React Hooks**:
  - `useState` to manage the visibility of an `Alert` component.
- **Conditional Rendering**:
  - Displaying components based on state (e.g., showing an alert only when a button is clicked).
- **Component Composition**:
  - Created reusable components like `Button` and `Alert`.
- **Props and Event Handling**:
  - Passing event handlers and props between components.

### ðŸ§  Extras

- **PascalCase** naming convention for component functions.

- Integration of Bootstrap to enhance UI quickly.
